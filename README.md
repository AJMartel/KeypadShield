# Lectrobox Keypad Shield
This is the software library for the
[Lectrobox Keypad Shield](http://www.lectrobox.com/keypad), making it simple for your
sketches to access the keypresses from a 16-key keypad. The keypad can either be
mounted directly on the Arduino, or connected remotely using a standard Ethernet cable.
The hardware, which includes both a shield and keypad, can be purchased at
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com).

##Supported Shields
The shield and library have been tested and known to work on a wide variety of
Arduino hardware:

###AVR-based Arduinos and clones:
* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Leonardo

###32-bit Arduinos:
* Arduino Zero

###Intel Curie Arduinos:
* Arduino 101

##Unsupported Shields

Note that the shield *does not support* older Arduinos such as the Diecimila,
Duemilanove, and other clones that do not have SDA and SCL pins as part of the
digital pin block.
